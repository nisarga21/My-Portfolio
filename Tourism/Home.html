                <b>The site where Mysore Palace now stands was occupied by a village named Puragere at the beginning of the 16th century.[21]:281 The Mahishūru Fort was constructed in 1524 by Chamaraja Wodeyar III (1513–1553),[21]:257 who passed on the dominion of Puragere to his son Chamaraja Wodeyar IV (1572–1576). Since the 16th century, the name of Mahishūru has commonly been used to denote the city.[22]:31 The Kingdom of Mysore, governed by the Wodeyar family, initially served as a vassal state of the Vijayanagara Empire. With the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire after the Battle of Talikota in 1565, the Mysore Kingdom gradually achieved independence, and by the time of King Narasaraja Wodeyar (1637) it had become a sovereign state.[23]:228 Seringapatam, near Mysore, the present-day Srirangapatna, was the capital of the kingdom from 1610.[21]:257 The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and, under Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar, the kingdom annexed large areas of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu, to become a powerful state in the southern Deccan.</b>
